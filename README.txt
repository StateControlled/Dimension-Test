Developed with NeoForge for Minecraft 1.20.4

This mod is a proof of concept that aims to create a Backrooms-like dimension.
Specifically, the objective is to create Poolrooms-type terrain using either an infinitely generated jigsaw structure or using a custom carver to randomly generate underground terrain.
